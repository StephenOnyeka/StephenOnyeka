If this app should go in-depth on fullstack development, I will upload it to github, download/clone/pull it from github direct and give a seperate name for the folder and keep referencing back to it in times of need.

I do not understand how the WorkoutContext.js works, the each line of codes and what they mean.


The purpose of this app is to be able post blogs that stores at the database and the ability of subscribed users to receive messages once a blog is posted. Although in this project form was used instead of real blog .
